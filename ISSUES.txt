# Approach: Loading JBoss Modules in static initializer

* -Djava.util.logging.manager=org.jboss.logmanager.LogManager must be passed at build time, otherwise not found by Logging extension...
This implies logmanager initialized at build time...
* ssd* in the classpath enforce some static initialization of logmanager. Such jars are not added to the classpath.
